***MACROS***

Macros will unfold to operations. While in theory you could just write all operations directly macro's are easier to use. Control-flow macros operate on blocks. Blocks are formed by indention using Tab characters.

Raise name (string)
	Raises a variables value just like 'Set name, name + 1' would.
Lower name (string)
	Lowers a variable by one. The same as 'Set name, name - 1' would.
Repeat i (number)
	Repeat the following block of code i times
While cnd (bool)
	Repeat the following block of code while cnd evaluates to true
Until cnd (bool)
	Repeat the following block of code while cnd evaluates to false
If cnd (bool)
	Execute the following block only if cnd is true
Else
	Only usable after an If macro. Executes the following block if previous If-condition was false. Can be chained with further If macros.

Here's a (pointless - but syntactical correct) example of flow control macros to illustrate how they work together:

#letscount
set i, 0
repeat 2
	while i < 12
		raise i
		if i%3=0
			out i, 'multiple of 3
		else if i%2=1
			out i, 'uneven
		else
			out i
	until i <= 0
		lower i, 2
		out i
