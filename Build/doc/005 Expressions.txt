***EXPRESSIONS***

Algebraic Expressions adhere to the usual rules and support the following functions:
	
	Basic Trigonometric Functions:(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions)
		sin(degree)
		cos(degree)
		tan(degree)

	Other Functions
		exp(a)				- natural (base-e) exponential function 
		ln(a)				- base-e logarithm, the inverse of exp
		floor(a)			- rounds down to next lowest integer
		ceil(a) 			- rounds up to next highest integer
		frac(a)				- returns the fractional part of a number
		abs(a)				- makes negative numbers positive

		min(a,b,...)  		- returns the smallest of the passed numbers
		max(a,b,...) 		- returns the biggest of the passed numbers
		clamp(a, min, max)	- constrains a to the interval between min and max
	
		time()				- returns the current runtime of the programm in seconds
		random()			- returns a random number between 0 and 1
		
	Note: Modulo is implemented as operator '%' and not a function.

Logical Expressions use the following keywords as operators/literals.
	not, and, or, true, false, is, isnt
