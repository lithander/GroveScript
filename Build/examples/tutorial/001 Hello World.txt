out 'Hello World

/*
This one line above is all you need to see some reaction from Grove.

The first word "out" is a command. It tells Grove to take whatever comes next and print it on the screen.

Change the text behind the ' character and save the file (Strg-S) and you should see Grove adapting to the change instantly.

In case you wonder what the ' does there: It tells Grove that the following characters are meant to be text.

This of course implies that if the following characters aren't text the ' isn't neaded. For example "out 1337" would be a perfectly valid command.

Valid or not - you probably think printing text to be rather boring and I agree. But it's traditional for tutorials about programming languages to start with teaching the subject (YOU) how to print "Hello World" on the screen and who am I to mess with tradition?

In the next step we'll learn how to make Grove draw.
