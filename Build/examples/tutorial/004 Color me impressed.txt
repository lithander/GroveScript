Thanks to the "repeat" command it takes only 3 lines to draw a complex shape such as an octagon, a pentagram and a lot of other geometrical shapes, too.

The "positon" command is pretty helpful too because it allows you to place the turtle freely and without drawing.

And here are some other commands that will all help you to draw fancy stuff.

"direction" is like "position" in that it allows you to set the rotation of the turtle in an absolute fashion instead of relative to where it currently sits.

Then we got "aim" which is another alternative for setting the turtle's direction. "aim 5, 10" will make the turtle look at the position 5, 10.

Last but not least drawing a thin, white line is not all the turtle can do.

You can set the line width with the "size" command and the line color with the "rgb" and "hsv" command.

I let wikipedia explain the details.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV

And now you can start drawing colorful pictures that resemble what you did in pre-school just that now you have an obedient Turtle to do all the work.

Oh and it's pretty fast too. Hit the S-Key in Grove and you'll notice that it actually draws the same drawing a couple hundred times per second. Computer's don't mind repetition.
